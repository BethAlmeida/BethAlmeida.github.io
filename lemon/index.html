<h1>LEMONS</h1>

<section id= 'about'><ol>
<li>Lemon trees bloom and produce fruit year-round. Each tree can produce between 500 and 600 pounds of lemons in a year.</li>
<li>Next time you have a sore throat, reach for a lemon!
Add the juice of one lemon to an equal amount of hot water for an anti-bacterial gargle.</li>
<li>Food historians say lemons have been in cultivation around the Mediterranean from as early as the first century A.D.</li>
<li>High in vitamin C, lemons prevent scurvy, a disease that causes bleeding gums, loose teeth and aching joints. To this day, the British Navy requires ships to carry enough lemons so that every sailor can have one ounce of juice a day.</li>
<li>The demand for lemons and their scurvy-preventing properties hit a peak during the California Gold Rush of 1849. Miners were willing to pay huge sums for a single lemon. As a result, lemon trees were planted in abundance throughout California.</li>
<li>During the European Renaissance, fashionable ladies used lemon juice as a way to redden their lips.</li>
<li>California and Arizona produce 95% of the entire U.S. lemon crop.</li>
